# lRenjector
 - I thought it would be a good idea to share one of my projects with you. Now I want to introduce you to my injector -lRejector.

## Instructions:
1. Install the contents from git in a way that is convenient for you and open the .sln.
2. Create a server in discord and create a webhook integration there, and paste the link in place of "Your discord webhook. Example: https://discord.com/api/... "
3. Implement the injection method and inject it into the code.
4. In the injector, select the game and then inject the DLL
That's it. I hope this information is useful to someone.
